# Accident-and-Anti-Theft-Detection-System
This project leverages a deep learning model using YOLO (You Only Look Once) on a Raspberry Pi-equipped camera to detect accidents and notify emergency services. The system is capable of real-time accident detection, sending alerts to the police, ambulance, and fire station if fire is detected.
