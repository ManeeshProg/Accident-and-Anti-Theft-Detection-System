# Accident-and-Anti-Theft-Detection-System
This project leverages a deep learning model using YOLO (You Only Look Once) on a Raspberry Pi-equipped camera to detect accidents and notify emergency services. The system is capable of real-time accident detection, sending alerts to the police, ambulance, and fire station if fire is detected. Additionally, it connects to a cloud server, allowing it to receive commands to detect specific cars, persons, and other entities, providing enhanced surveillance capabilities.

Features
Accident Detection: Real-time identification of accidents with immediate notification to emergency services.
Fire Detection: Alerts relevant authorities in case of fire detection during an accident.
Custom Detection: Receives commands from a cloud server to detect specific cars, persons, and other entities.
Anti-Theft Capabilities:
Vehicle Theft Prevention: Detects unauthorized access to vehicles and alerts authorities.
Intrusion Detection: Monitors areas for unauthorized personnel and suspicious activities.
Asset Protection: Tracks valuable assets, providing real-time alerts if they are moved or tampered with.
Parking Lot Security: Identifies suspicious behavior in parking lots and notifies security personnel.
Benefits
Faster Emergency Response Times: Enables quicker response from emergency services, potentially saving lives.
Improved Public Safety: Ensures accidents are detected promptly, reducing the severity of injuries.
Enhanced Monitoring Capabilities: Customizable detection for specific surveillance needs.
Comprehensive Security: Provides robust anti-theft and security monitoring for vehicles and assets.

Usage
Real-time Detection: Run the script to start detecting accidents and intrusions in real-time.
Cloud Integration: Connect to your cloud server to receive custom detection commands.
